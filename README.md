Just a test/demonstration of deploying a simple frontend to Google Cloud Run, built with GitHub Actions, pushed to Google Cloud Artifact Registry, and deployed on Google Cloud Run.

An environment secret (from the GitHub environment) is passed to the `docker build` step.

There used to be another repo called gh-actions-frontend-test, which was moved to gcloud-build-frontend-test.
